Implicit sexism refers to subtle or indirect expressions of gender bias that reinforce stereotypes.

Example: “Women are naturally worse at math.”

Implicit sexism can appear as assumptions about competence, roles, or behavior.

Example: “She is too emotional to lead a team.”

Sexism may also be framed as jokes or casual remarks that normalize inequality.
